Accurate carbon price forecasting within the European Union's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) is essential for guiding policy and investment decisions in the transition to a low-carbon economy. This study evaluates and compares the performance of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Random Forest (RF), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models in predicting carbon prices during Phase 4 (2021â€“2024) of the EU ETS. While incorporating macroeconomic indicators, energy prices, weather conditions, and stock indices, the models are assessed for their ability to capture the dynamics of carbon pricing. The results highlight that all three models perform well in forecasting carbon prices, and all achieve robust forecasting accuracy, demonstrating their suitability for the relatively stable regulatory conditions of Phase 4. This study offers guidance for stakeholders navigating the complexities of carbon markets and climate policy.
